Create a Web Crawler to to get specific real estate listing from two real-estate websites (VPS Server1 - Linux) and load them into a mysql database (VPS Server2 - Linux). Processing the data will be phase 2 after this project is done. \n\nThe Crawler should act like a normal visitor on the website, should not cause any harm or stress the real-estate server. \nIf the site bans the crawler, it should be easily movable to another VPS server.\n\nThe crawled urls should be customizable in the config file (the 2 real estate site has 2 different formats so probably best to have 2 separate tables)\n\nThe Crawler should scan the specified site every 30 minutes (number should also be customizable from a config file) and add new records to the database.\nThis assumes the crawled list is compared to database.\n\nData to be collected from the site: district, street, price, size, rooms, url\n\nThe 2 sites to be crawled:\nhxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/\nhxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/\n\nFor Example:\nI would add the following url's in the config file (district V. properties). On the first site there are 207 hits on 11 page, on second 79 hits \nI would only specify the first URL, the crawler should continue on page 2, page 3 until finds and empty page.\n\nhxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/szukites\/elado+lakas+csak-magan+v-ker \nhxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/szukites\/elado+lakas+csak-magan+v-ker?page=2\nhxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/szukites\/elado+lakas+csak-magan+v-ker?page=3\nhxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/szukites\/elado+lakas+csak-magan+v-ker?page=4\n... until finished\n\nFor the other site:\n\nhxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/budapest\/v-kerulet\/ingatlan?f=p&st=s\nhxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/budapest\/v-kerulet\/ingatlan?f=p&st=s&o=2\nhxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/budapest\/v-kerulet\/ingatlan?f=p&st=s&o=3\nhxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/budapest\/v-kerulet\/ingatlan?f=p&st=s&o=4\n\nDatabase design on VPS Server2:\n\nDatabase table should hold this data:\n\nSold (flag) - The crawled list should be compared to the database records. This flag should be updated to 'Y' if the crawled list does not contain a record that is present in the database\n\nPrice updated (flag) - The crawled list should be compared to database records. If the price is different for the same property, the price field should be updated with the new price and this \nflag to be update to 'Y'\n\nUrl (unique): \nExample1: hxxp:\/\/realestatehungary.hu\/viii-ker\/elado+lakas\/tegla-epitesu-lakas\/budapest+8+district+krudy+utca\/22622719\nExample2: hxxp:\/\/www.jofogas.hu\/budapest\/Elado_Bp___V_ker_Vaci_u__nal_2millio_Ft_val_ara_alatt_54m2_es_lakas_52485032.htm?first=1\n\nDescription (Text): \nExample1: Kr\u00fady utca\nExample1: Elad\u00f3 Bp., V.ker V\u00e1ci u.-n\u00e1l 2milli\u00f3 Ft-val \u00e1ra alatt 54m2-es lak\u00e1s \n\nDistrict (number only): Example: V or 5\n\nSize\/SQM (number only): Example: 64\n\nPrice (number only, 1.000.000 format - so for example on realestatehungary the prices should be multiplied up with 1 million): Example: 39000000\n\nCurrency (can be fixed to 'HUF' for all record)\n\nSqm price (number - this field needs to be calculated = (Price \/ size): Example: 609375\n\nTime & Date when property added to database\nTime & Date when property last updated in database \n\nOther considerations:\nSold houses (flag Y) should be removed from the database after 30 days.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["data-scraping","mysql","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-09-17T17:54:31+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01f25731e858ee1b67","client":{"country":"Netherlands","feedback":5,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":17,"past_hires":8,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
