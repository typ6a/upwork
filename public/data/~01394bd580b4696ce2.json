{"id":"~01394bd580b4696ce2","title":"Facebook Business Page Cover Photo for Charity","snippet":"I am looking to get a professional looking Facebook Business Page Cover Photo created. If we like what you do, we need a new one every 2 months.\n\nIt needs to be clean, neat, glossy, high quality. \n\nOur 5 main services, have 5 logos, which need to be neatly displayed vertically on the left hand edge (along with the text Surveys, Rewards, Competitions, Games, Charity near each, perhaps just to the right of it). I will include the existing icons here - https:\/\/www.livetribe.com\/ilink\/pms_client\/tribe_v3\/login\/FACEBOOK_AD\n\nThe Logo of our website also needs to be present (LiveTribe Noble Causes) which I can attach as well. Doesn't need to dominate the entire banner, just large enough where it can be read clearly and recognised. \n\nThe charity we are supporting this month is a park that cares for sick and injured baby wombats. Would like them featured in the banner too. \nCould the background for the banner perhaps be a cork board? With photos of the wombats as retro Polaroid pictures pinned on like someone was collecting them. Will also include a small picture of the Wombat Rescue Logo that can be a Polaroid pic too. Perhaps the icons on the far left as well as the LiveTribe\/Noble Causes Logo could also be worked into this theme? . \n\n","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Graphic Design","skills":["adobe-photoshop","banner-design","graphic-design","logo-design","photo-editing","web-design"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":15,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T10:04:30+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01394bd580b4696ce2","client":{"country":"Australia","feedback":5,"reviews_count":2,"jobs_posted":5,"past_hires":4,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
