{"id":"~01c0bea3ddf6611db7","title":"Need PPC expert to set up Adwords Campaign","snippet":"I've launched a service marketplace (lazerleads.workify.co) which connects people who want sales leads, influencer marketing contacts, and contacts for backlink outreach (among others) to connect with freelancers who scrape emails and generate contact lists. \n\nI want to drive paid ad traffic to the site but it is pretty competitive pricing for keywords like \"lead generation.\" I want someone to set up a paid ad campaign (may be adwords, it may be facebook which has cheaper CPC). Looking initially for the set up and research and later then if job done well will hire for maintenance and monitoring of the ad spend.
