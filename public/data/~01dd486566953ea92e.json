I recently quit my job to have a break and now I'm going to startup my own company. Before today, I had no idea this type of sites existed, and this is the first time I actually need any form of freelancer. That is the reason for new account! \n\nGroundbase for my startup would be to get statistics from ads, from 3 different sites wich is basically the same as ebay. \n\nLight specc: \n- Create a job that scraps data information from every add that comes out on the sites.\n\n- The job needs to refresh page and check if there is any update, around every minute in order to catch all adds. \n\n- Set up a database where all the information will process that I can easily create querys in order to get the information that I'm in search of, and transfer them to excel file. \n\nThis is just a simple specc for you, before we go any further. Next step would be to read the detailed specc, and see if it's performable and what the cost would be. \n\nFirst step is one-time project to develoup my groundbase, in order to advance to next step. if everything goes as planned it will be much more work around this project! \n\nHope to hear from you! \n\nBest regards, \nEmil Eriksson","category2":"Admin Support","subcategory2":"Data Entry","skills":["web-scraping"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T11:36:40+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01dd486566953ea92e","client":{"country":"Norway","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFICATIONINPROGRESS"}}
