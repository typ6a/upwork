{"id":"~014e6b8e24c81c6a83","title":"Need a Web Scraper to Scrape University Contacts and Paste on Excel","snippet":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking to hire somebody who can scrape 2 American universities for me. We are looking to obtain the contact information of the professors at the universities. \r\n\r\nYou will be in charge of populating the spreadsheet with the qualified contacts ( directions provided in other documents). \r\n\r\nI have included an example set of directions for 1 of the 2 universities we want to scrape. You will simply place their contact info into a spreadsheet which will be provided for both universities, along with detailed instructions for each university. The other university we want to scrape is UCLA university, and will essentially follow the same guidelines and rules, although the layout of their website is slightly different.\r\n\r\nThis task MUST be completed by Monday (10\/31) at 8AM Pacific Standard Time.  Please message me if interested and if you would like to see the template for the UCLA university as well. Please contact me ASAP with questions \r\n\r\nThank you!","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Mining & Management","skills":["microsoft-excel","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":100,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T18:09:41+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~014e6b8e24c81c6a83","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":2.35,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":10,"past_hires":3,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
