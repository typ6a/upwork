{"id":"~018a20ef8ec9678354","title":"Accurate List Building for Steel Industry","snippet":"Hi, \n\nOur company name is Steel Distributor, Inc. We are looking to tap into the following American West Coast States: Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii. Our targeting clients deal with rebar (reinforcing bar also called deformed bar).\n\nI am looking for the Name, Company Name, Title, Phone Number and Email Address of people dealing in the following industries:\n\n1. Rebar Fabricators\n2. Rebar Suppliers\n3. Rebar Distributors \n4. Rebar Service Centers\n\nIn my last experience with hiring someone to find me contacts, I noticed that may of those emails were bounced because either they were outdated or incorrect. So the focus would be to find accurate personal emails. We are interested in contacting the person that deals with purchasing\/procurement. If you cannot find the person in purchasing\/procurement then somebody in sales works too. \n\nI want to offer 20 hours of work to begin with. Depending on the quality of work and the accuracy of emails, I am more than willing to give you more product categories and regions to work on. But for now, west coast American states and the product is rebar. \n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nThanks!\nHussain","category2":"Sales & Marketing","subcategory2":"Lead Generation","skills":["data-mining","data-scraping","lead-generation"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T23:07:20+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018a20ef8ec9678354","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":1,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
