{"id":"~0163d31750b6394c46","title":"Chrome Extensions to scrape eBay","snippet":"I'm looking for some help developing a script that will scrape ebay listings and display a table with \"Ebay Listing Name\", \"Amazon Product Name\", \"Amazon Sales Rank\", \"Amazon Category\", \"Amazon Price\", \"Net Profit\", and \"ROI\".\n\nThe idea candidate will write clean code that is easily modified, as there will be several expansions on this going forward.\n\nIt's important that this extension allows a user to enter the price of inbound shipping (e.g. $0.50\/lb) and for the ROI calculation to take into account FBA fees and inbound shipping.  \n\nAdditionally I would want the app to be able to sort by number of feedback for the seller AND quantity available.  \n\nThe initial product doesn't have to be pretty.  I'm more concerned about the functionality. \n\nTo be clear, it should function similar to the following:\n1) User clicks a button to activate the extension\n2) Extension scrapes the ebay page that the user is on, and attempts to match with Amazon via UPC or Title along with storing the quantity available and the seller feedback information\n3) Extension polls Amazon to get weight information (to calculate inbound shipping), rank, fba fees, and the current buy-box price.\n4) This information is displayed in a table for the user to filter\/sort by ROI, seller feedback, quantity available, and item rank.\n\nThank you for your interest in this project.  Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nJon","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["amazon-mws","chrome-extension","data-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":250,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T21:06:37+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0163d31750b6394c46","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":13,"jobs_posted":46,"past_hires":21,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
