{"id":"~0188ac80a25a6c6fec","title":"Visual UX\/web designer needed to make grid-based\/responsive PSD mockup","snippet":"We are looking for an experienced visual designer to participate in a large web project. Functional usability and good UX according to best practices are important - more important than visual looks and pixel perfection, although looks are a part. An example of what we are after is work flow intensive applications like CRM systems or collaboration software such as Trello.\n\nWe want to see work samples with thought through usability and looks. You must have experience working specifically with web, including responsive design and grid patterns.\n\nWe expect the output to be PSD or vector based mockups, where elements are sliced and can be extracted to web assets directly from the mockup. Knowledge of HTML\/CSS is not necessary, but considered a plus. \n\nThe primary market for the customer is Scandinavian, so we are looking for that high-end scandinavian touch to the design.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web & Mobile Design","skills":["adobe-photoshop","graphic-design","web-design"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"3 to 6 months","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T16:03:18+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0188ac80a25a6c6fec","client":{"country":"Spain","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
