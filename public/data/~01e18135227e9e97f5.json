I'm not a Python expert.\r\n\r\nI'm a PHP Developer who is seeking for Python support during a Data Mining project, since Python seems to be a better fit for the task.\r\n\r\nThe project is a replicable working process for Ubuntu which does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Scrape a major ecommerce site\r\n2. Extract information\r\n3. Compare extracted information with already stored (NoSQL Database) information\r\n4. Save the information within the DB if it's new\r\n\r\nThe main challenges:\r\n\r\n- Performance: I want an application which provides a good user experience through short response times\r\n- Ruggedness: I want to save over 200 million data pieces per year, the database structure should be persistent\r\n\r\nWho I am searching for?\r\nI'm seeking for one or more freelancers who are willing to take this challenge. I definately want someone for ongoing support and further dev tasks aroung this project.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Other - Software Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":null,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T14:01:27+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01e18135227e9e97f5","client":{"country":"Germany","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
