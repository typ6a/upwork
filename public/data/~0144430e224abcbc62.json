{"id":"~0144430e224abcbc62","title":"Collect and format large number of fashion brand logos","snippet":"I have a list of 174 brands where I need each brand's logo for use in an e-commerce offering.\n\nExamples of brands are:\n- http:\/\/www.acnestudios.com\/\n- https:\/\/brodiecashmere.com\/\n- http:\/\/cathrinehammel.no\/shop\/\n- http:\/\/www.houseofdagmar.se\/\n- http:\/\/www.equipmentfr.com\/shop\/\n\nThe job consists of the following:\n- You will receive a list of brands in excel with URLs, but may need to search to find the logo in the right size and format\n- The logo image should 1:1 in aspect. You need to increase canvas size on most logos\n- The background should be transparent\n- The logo should be in Black & White, centered on the canvas with a 50-60 px margin on each side of the logo\n\n- Output 1: PNG in large\/original size. The pixel size will normally depend on the size of the logo you downloaded  (e.g 600x600, 850x850, 1200x1200, 1320x1320, etc). No need to resize the image after processing.\n- Output 2: is a 350x350px png, max 20 kb\n\nI will give you access to a dropbox folder to store the output.\n\nI have about 20 logos that I need within some days, but the remaining ones can be done over time. There is likely to be a need for further logos along the way, and potentially other simple image processing (cropping of images, resizing etc)\n\n\n\n","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Graphic Design","skills":["adobe-photoshop","adobe-photoshop-lightroom","graphic-design"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T08:59:36+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0144430e224abcbc62","client":{"country":"Norway","feedback":4.9506433597,"reviews_count":11,"jobs_posted":16,"past_hires":24,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
