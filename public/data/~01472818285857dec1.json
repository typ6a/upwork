{"id":"~01472818285857dec1","title":"Need Python Engineer to Create YouTube Search Tool","snippet":"Looking for someone very familiar with the YouTube API, Web scrapping and creating efficient scripts to help with this YouTube Search Tool we're building. The tool would have a simple web interface where you could put in a keyword - the tool would then search and filter and re-search based on a number of parameters that I will share later. It will then give a cleaned list of results that are downloadable as an Excel file. I will share more details once we connect.
