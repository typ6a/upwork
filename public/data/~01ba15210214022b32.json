{"id":"~01ba15210214022b32","title":"Seeking Experienced Development Company for Commercial Software Appliation","snippet":"About Us\n\nHoot Interactive is a small digital advertising firm that is now entering the commercial software business.  We have developed a set of tools that automate processes associated with managing search advertising campaigns on the Google AdWords network.  Our customers are other digital advertising agencies that provide services to primarily auto dealerships.  \n\n\nAbout Our Software\n\nOur software is currently named the \u201cInventory Monitor\u201d due to its original purpose of integrating vehicle inventory levels with AdWords campaigns.  e.g. When a Toyota Tundra is in inventory, associated ads are activated.  When not in inventory, associated ads are paused.  Instead of accomplishing this integration by connecting with an inventory data feed, we crawl every URL of every ad to determine if it lands on a page with a successful list of vehicles or a \u201cno results found\u201d page.  The landing page experience then determines the status of the ad.  \n\nA slightly more detailed description of our software can be found at http:\/\/www.hootinteractive.com\/sem-software\/.  \n\n\nWhat We\u2019re Looking For\n\nWe are seeking a long-term partnership with a reputable, experienced software development company to accelerate our dev schedules.
