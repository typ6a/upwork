Ticketmaster.com and Livenation.com redesigned their website and the program no longer scrapes from the new versions.  I'd like to have someone update this software to work with the new websites.  I'd like all the previous functionality to work once updated.  \n\nI'd be happy to provide you with the software so you can look at it and determine if you can handle it.
