The program is a very basic program and should be real easy to do.\n\nBasically I want to enter a bunch of keywords in a box.  The Program would then go to amazon and search each of those keywords. For each keyword I would like to know how many of the results on the first page have the keywords in the exact match plus how many do not.  It can be shown as \n\nkeyword 1 20% exact match 80 percent non match X percent have zero words\nkeyword 2 20% exact match 80 percent non match X percent have zero words\nkeyword 3 20% exact match 80 percent non match X percent have zero words\nkeyword 4 20% exact match 80 percent non match X percent have zero words\n\nKeywords with higher than 60% non match should be green. Those with less red\n\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Desktop Software Development","skills":["adobe-air"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T00:04:00+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0190b740824cc6ec0d","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.6960076587,"reviews_count":67,"jobs_posted":208,"past_hires":119,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
