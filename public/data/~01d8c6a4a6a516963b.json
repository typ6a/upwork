{"id":"~01d8c6a4a6a516963b","title":"Shopify Developer","snippet":"Hi there,\n\nI need help customizing a client's Shopify website. I used a premium theme, but I'm limited to what the theme offers. \n\nTo achieve the look she is after I have created the pages (services, about, giving back etc) using images. This is not ideal because of responsiveness & SEO as you would probably know.\n\nWhat I'm looking for, is for someone to take my design and style the content on the pages to look like my design. \n\nI've also created a fake collection page to achieve what she wanted, but now the breadcrumb navigation doesn't direct to it. That will need to be fixed as well. \n\nIn total it will be 6 to 10 pages. All having a very similar layout & design.\n\nThank you\nMichaela","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["shopify"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T14:37:59+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01d8c6a4a6a516963b","client":{"country":null,"feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
