The system should be capable of performing at the petabyte scale.\r\n\r\nSystem should be able to ingest large volumes of unstructured log files (~700 log sources) and perform analytics. The specifics of what information we are trying to extract will be discussed with the winning proposer. Formats of each of the log files will be given and it will become necessary to use the log files to design a system that baseline's normal behavior of an endpoint based on log file history.\r\n\r\nA secondary part of the project involves advanced methods to track a document. If a document is stored on or off of a users network. We should have constant or persistent awareness of it's location.","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Visualization","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":4000,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T21:30:45+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01069fe619dbfb4729","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
