{"id":"~018686a296176ae6db","title":"Program to extract information from website","snippet":"I need a desktop program written that will access a website with given parameters, and return the value. It is a website for a courier, and I need to know the delivery costs for parcels with set weights and volumes.\n\nThe program will need to continually input values, and based on the values, return and store the data.\n\nE.g. If the input parameters are 23 x 23 x 18, 3kg, Sydney 2000, the program will need to return the value $8.50\n\nIdeally, the program will read the input values from 3 or 4 text files, and store the data in another text file.\n\nI have a program that does this already, however I need it written for another website - I can supply a copy of the existing program so that modifications can be made.\n\nThe program can run concurrently on several computers to 'speed' it up, however I need it to run quickly, given the number of inputs.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Desktop Software Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":100,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T07:11:29+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018686a296176ae6db","client":{"country":"Australia","feedback":5,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":3,"past_hires":2,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
