We\u2019re looking for someone to create a report comparing different aspects of our content from textual analysis to date\/time.\n\nReport Requirements\nGiven a list of 4-5 news websites and looking at the last 30 days create a report comparing the sites and individual reports for each site.\n\nComparative Report\n\u2022\tSite\u2019s Average Posts per day \u2013 each site\u2019s average number of posts per day\n\u2022\tSites\u2019 Average Shares per article \u2013 each site\u2019s average number of shares per article during time period  (eg.

See: https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/graph-api\/reference\/v2.8\/url\n\u2022\tWe may want to run this report from time to time, so let us know how we might do that (if it\u2019s code that can be installed on a simple hosting account, or uses third party service, etc).\n","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Extraction \/ ETL","skills":["data-analysis","data-scraping"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T22:15:03+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~011f8c998833f89eaf","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9852169414,"reviews_count":11,"jobs_posted":37,"past_hires":34,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
