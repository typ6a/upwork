{"id":"~01f10933379e24dd47","title":"Looking for someone to co-code with me - PHP","snippet":"need someone like a student with a pretty good understanding of PHP and basic MySQL. This will be about 3-7 hours a week for about a month.\n\nMain requirement is an ability to NOT push for much better solution. I am building 90% of this beta website BUT my PHP is fair to average.\n\nI need help with PDO, reading multi-dimensional arrays and using classes.\n\nWhat I am NOT looking is for someone to say \u201cThis should be MVC\u201d etc. To be honest it will be 10-25% real spaghetti code but I am building this site and I have to be able to understand it. This is the fourth iteration of this site and each version has been a step forward. \n\nA typical interaction will be me giving you access to a parallel site, with well commented code with a short explanation of a couple of problems EG: I cannot extract the correct column from the DB with this PDO\/foreach loop\u201d.\n\nYou will see horrible things like multiple calls to the DB instead of complicated three table joins, you will see classes poorly used and functions OUTSIDE of classes. If this horrifies you PLEASE STAY AWAY. Every time I post a request like this I end up with people saying \u2013 you should not do this like this!!! My site my rules. \n\nNow if I have not put you off I would love to hear from you. \nSteve","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["jquery","mysql-programming","php"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T22:21:02+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01f10933379e24dd47","client":{"country":"United Kingdom","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
