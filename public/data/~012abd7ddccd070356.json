{"id":"~012abd7ddccd070356","title":"Academic article relating to clinical treatment for submission to professional journal","snippet":"We have an amazing vaginal treatment ( www.genesis.clinic), that has been gaining lots of positive reviews and have been collating lots of pre-op and post op data over the last 6 months. It is part of a nurse led service which is rolling out in the whole country in the next 6 months\nWe have been featured in national newspapers x 3 and are fast becoming a recognised brand. \nWe need to have an article to submit to professional journals ( preferably nursing\/ gynae) to get the message out to the wider medical community for further validation.\n\nWe would ideally like to use the data we have collected and spot trends, but if the sample is too small, then an article looking at nurse led service and referring to the reviews may be better. Any links you have to the target journal will be helpful.\n\nHappy to be advised.","category2":"Writing","subcategory2":"Academic Writing & Research","skills":["academic-writing","medical-writing","research"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T15:26:57+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~012abd7ddccd070356","client":{"country":"United Kingdom","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":44,"past_hires":25,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
