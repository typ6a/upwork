You would be reading English language web pages about automobiles, finding relevant pieces of information, and entering the information into the appropriate cell of the sheet.   There will be a variety of types of web pages, including specifications from car  manufacturers, reviews from various organizations, and blog posts by individual people.  Being precise about the particular model of automobile that is being discussed (and asking me when you're not sure) is important to knowing where to put the information in the sheet, as is double-checking that data has been entered correctly.
