{"id":"~01c41f71f2a9228216","title":"two-axis solar tracker circuit design powered by 2x2 array of thermoelectric generators","snippet":"Need analog design of solar tracker based on using a 2x2 array of Peltier thermoelectric (TE) generators to sense the position of the sun and to use the TE generator power output to drive a pair of small DC motors, one for each tracker motion axis (azimuth and elevation).  The specific TE Generators used are shown in the Ebay screen grab attached.  Ideally it would be best to avoid microcontrollers and work with \"old school\" monolithic analog components.  Design can include a DC battery to power electronics if needed.  Concentrated sunlight will illuminate the 2x2 array of TE generators and the output of these needs to drive a pair of geared 5VDC motors, one for each axis.  When operating correctly the tracker will keep the sun's image centered on the center of the 2x2 array.\n\nCurrent motor choice from Solarbotics:\nYour order includes the following:\n2x - GM17  - Gear Motor 17 - 228:1 HE Offset Shaft\n\nThere is a decent chance that we may have to upgrade the motor to provide more torque.  We did a test today to validate that concentrated solar for a single TE generator can drive a single motor.  \n\nFinally, would be best if the TE generator circuit can utilize (matrix element notation) (1,1) and (2,1) as a pair opposing (1,2) and (2,2) to provide the \"x axis\" motor drive power and (1,1) and (1,2) as a pair opposing (2,1) and (2,2) to provide the \"y axis\" motor drive power.\n\n","category2":"Engineering & Architecture","subcategory2":"Electrical Engineering","skills":["circuit-design"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T19:32:05+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01c41f71f2a9228216","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
