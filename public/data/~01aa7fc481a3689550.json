German text on the other side).\n\n8 flashcards \/ section per A4.\n\nI have data in an excel spreadsheet.\n\nAbout 1100 lines, and 7 columns.\n\nThis data needs to be organised on into different sections on A4.\n\nA4 page is split into 8 sections.\n\nI need to extracted data from excel, and organise it into different sections.\n\nThe process is repetitive, so a SCRIPT is necessary, or some sort of RULE.\n\nI want to be able to to change the font size, font type. and also format how and where exactly the data is in the sections (8 sections per A4 page)\n\n\nI have attached an example of how it should look like.\n\nWhat is IN YELLOW COLOUR should NOT be printed. It's just for explanation \/ reference.\n\nS1, S2, S3, S4... are NOT data from the speadsheet, and should NOT be added to the square. They are just references.\n\nS1 = section 1\nS2 = section 2\nS3 = section 3\nS4 = section 4, etc...\n\nS7 and S8, and S15 and S16 is an example with the actual data.\n\nData in [ square brackets ] refers to excel cell numbers where the content comes from.\n\n\nIf you wish to apply, please let me know HOW to plan to solve this problem. I don't need the exact details, but tell me if: you plan to do the pagination within excel, OR if you plan to use a script, or any other method.\n\n\nThank you!","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Visualization","skills":["excel-vba","microsoft-excel"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":10,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T14:04:19+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01aa7fc481a3689550","client":{"country":"Switzerland","feedback":2.65,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":13,"past_hires":5,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
