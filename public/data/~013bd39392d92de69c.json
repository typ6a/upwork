{"id":"~013bd39392d92de69c","title":"Need someone to build a wordpress membership site","snippet":"In January 2017 I'm launching an online yoga membership site. I'm using moonclerk.com to collect recurring payments. You can view my sales page here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/lunaryoga\n\nI'm not at all familiar with wordpress so I would like someone to make me a simple video based subscription website, preferably that can accept affiliates.\n\nSince I'm accepting payments through Moonclerk.com I don't need the website to process payments but it will need to somehow prompt users to create a username and password in order to access the videos. I already own the domain and have a host. I have not decided on a membership plugin and leave that up to you to decide the one that will work best keeping in mind that my content is almost all video based.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Ecommerce Development","skills":["wordpress"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":500,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T18:53:09+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~013bd39392d92de69c","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":4.5326086957,"reviews_count":3,"jobs_posted":5,"past_hires":3,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
