{"id":"~018758101f754611f4","title":"Iframe Cutter Software","snippet":"Looking for a smart developer to build an iframe cutter tool.\n\nMust be a web based or desktop software that can cut specific frames from a url.\nBelow are the steps:\n\n1. Cut a specific element of a web page that is not mine. For a example, a button or contact form.\n\n2. Generate the iframe code\/url.\n\n3. I then place the iframe code on my website, thus embedding the button or contact form on my webpage.\n\nThe iframe must be linked to its original source although it is placed on my website. If it's a button I iframe, if a user clicks on the frame from my website they are basically clicking on the frame from the URL where it was cut.\n\nIf the project goes well we will hire you for more of our similar projects.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["c","c#","c++","data-scraping","html","html5","javascript","php","python","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T08:36:47+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018758101f754611f4","client":{"country":"France","feedback":4.9924702174,"reviews_count":65,"jobs_posted":125,"past_hires":100,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
