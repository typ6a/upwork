We already process donations via credit card via Form Assembly \/ Stripe \/ Salesforce integration, but since we dropped Authorize.net due to cost, I didn't realize processing ACH via Stripe was so complicated. We are a very small nonprofit organization but do have a few donors who like to give via eCheck or auto bank draft. I see where Stripe provides all the code in the API section but it's over my head as to how to put it all together. This is probably a very small job. We already collect the information from the customer via our existing form, and this new form would just be for us to manually set up the transaction, since we have very few to deal with.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Ecommerce Development","skills":["javascript"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":6,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T22:36:22+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01e3933f4cc6f10777","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
