{"id":"~011698fa455bd24e90","title":"Upload videos from S3 to YouTube via Lambda","snippet":"We have video files stored on S3 and controlled by a number of Lambda functions.\nThey update the videos on schedule adding new frames.\n\nWe need to upload the videos to YouTube to replace the files.\nThe actual listings do not need to be created or amended - only the files replaced.\n\n== PROPOSED SOLUTION ==\n\nCreate a static HTML page linked to AWS API Gateway and Lambda to grab YouTube tokens. The user would have to log in to their YouTube account and the lambda would grab the creds via the normal OAuth process to store them in S3 for future use.\n\nAnother L-function will upload a video as soon as it has been changed in S3.\n\nSee more in https:\/\/github.com\/hubsy-io\/timelapse\/issues\/18\n\n== TECHNOLOGY ==\n\nAWS products: S3, Lambda, IAM, etc.\n\nThe project should take approximately 3 days to complete.\nThere is a lot of open source code floating around for what we need to do, but it needs to be put together into one neat solution.\n\nPlease, review https:\/\/github.com\/hubsy-io\/timelapse and https:\/\/github.com\/hubsy-io\/timelapse\/issues for more info.\n\n=== Special requirements ===\n\n* flexible working hours\n* software engineering level of skill\n* good issue tracking habits\n* good commenting and documenting habits\n* good written English\n* experience working with AWS\n* confident Git user\n\n=== Application requirements ===\n\n1. Send us a brief outline of your skills relevant to the tasks at hand.\n2. Include links to your public repos.\n3. Mention any experience in this area, if any.\n\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["amazon-s3","aws-lambda","imagemagick","node.js"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":500,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T01:38:41+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~011698fa455bd24e90","client":{"country":"New Zealand","feedback":4.0785876993,"reviews_count":7,"jobs_posted":75,"past_hires":19,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
