The design is based on an image timeline. I have started the design\/layout of the mural in InDesign and edited the images in Photoshop. I now have revisions from the client that i need someone to complete. The revisions include:\n- feathering\/blending\/merging images rather than how they currently appear which is square\/cleaned finish. You'll be able to see in the attached what i mean. \n- I also need additional photos to be added and some exiting images made smaller. The new\/additional photos will need to be made black and white also.\n\nI have attached a screen grab of the design. Once the freelancer has been approved i will supply all files including working InDesign files and images via Dropbox.","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Graphic Design","skills":["adobe-acrobat","adobe-indesign","adobe-photoshop","graphic-design","print-design"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T04:11:11+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01fa642f60ce58079f","client":{"country":"Australia","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
