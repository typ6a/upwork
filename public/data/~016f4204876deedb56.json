Super simple. \n\nI started coding it and can find the search result for each keyword, but I've come into a problem I don't know how to fix. I asked on stackoverflow.com you can see but no one answered yet http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/40314814\/get-request-looping-and-sending-data-outside-get-request-in-node-js\n\nAnyway this job will be hourly and what you should be able to do is look at my current code and fix it, as well as explain to me how it works and why.\n\nI would really rather it uses my code I've already made it just tweak it from there than you coding a whole new different thing this way I can learn to make things work myself.\n\nI also need this asap so only apply if you are available right now.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["javascript","jquery","node.js","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T02:42:58+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~016f4204876deedb56","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":5,"reviews_count":12,"jobs_posted":25,"past_hires":18,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
