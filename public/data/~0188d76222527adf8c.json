{"id":"~0188d76222527adf8c","title":"Scraping linkedin users' data","snippet":"Looking for a person with experience in data scraping to collect some data about prolific (>500 connections) linkedin users. We would not be scraping the whole profile (to avoid violating their terms of service), but would just be compiling a database of:\n\nname | # of connections | email address\n\n(note - you may need to obtain the email address from another source since it is not a part of the public profile)\n\nPlease apply with quotes based on 1000 \/ 10,000 \/ 100,000 users volumes. We may start with a small lot but will eventually need to purchase higher and higher quantities each month.","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Mining & Management","skills":["data-scraping","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":5,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T22:04:54+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0188d76222527adf8c","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
