{"id":"~01cf7a930c0c164387","title":"Google Analytics (Paid Search)","snippet":"I need someone who has a deep knowledge of Google Analytics. We are working with a big organization on their paid search campaigns. Here are a few of the things we'll need:\n\n1. Need help reducing the amount of goals to keep under the 20 goal limit. (Is this something that\u2019s normally practiced when running media and tracking within Google Analytics?)\n2. Is separating the properties a good way for us to track our various different campaigns?\n3. Need help looking at and using Conversion Paths and Assisted Conversions. We are aware UTM codes only record Post Click impressions but we\u2019re hoping to maybe extract a little bit of information from the Paths and Assisted conversion reports. We\u2019re hoping to get more clarity and insights as to what the data is showing.\n4. Lastly, any kind of additional information about the site self would be helpful. Site speed, bounce rates, geo locations, etc.. We\u2019re looking to see if it\u2019d be possible to improve the websites in any way, or weed out any possible weak pages to streamline the browsing experience.\n\n\n\n\n","category2":"Sales & Marketing","subcategory2":"SEM - Search Engine Marketing","skills":["google-analytics"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T17:48:49+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01cf7a930c0c164387","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":17,"past_hires":11,"payment_verification_status":null}}
