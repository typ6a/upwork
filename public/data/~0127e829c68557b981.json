There are already reports that state the number of English language learners in each country and the total market size. So we do not need that information.\n   Market research for this project should focus on things like\n\n1. What are the reasons that people want to learn English? Do the reasons differ by country or by age? [rank them from most\/least important. Also, estimate how many people or what percentage of people fall into each category in the ranking and order the list from highest to lowest.\n\n2.  What are people using today to learn English? [rank the list based on number or percentage of people who use each technique.\n\n3. How much are people paying to learn English to day?\n\n4. How satisfied are people with the products that they are using?\n\n5. What do people feel they wish they had that they do not currently have with their English learning experience?\n\nEtc..\n\nPlease make sure that all responses are data driven and site sources, or provide surveys needed to collect data for the market research. If surveys are needed to collect the data, describe how people who take the survey will be targeted.\n\nThank you.","category2":"Sales & Marketing","subcategory2":"Market & Customer Research","skills":["market-research"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T16:16:12+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0127e829c68557b981","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":6,"past_hires":3,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
