It is last season and therefore no longer available, however, I don't mind buying it second hand or from old stock. I also don't mind buying it from abroad as long as it's through a reputable site.\n\nThis is the dress: https:\/\/www.net-a-porter.com\/gb\/en\/product\/609332\/msgm\/printed-crepe-maxi-dress \n\nI am tall\/large and ideally want the largest size IT48 (which is uk 16, european 42), but I will also accept a smaller size IT44 or IT46 and get it adjusted with insert side panels. \n\nHere's a useful link to size tables: https:\/\/www.net-a-porter.com\/intl\/pssizechart.nap?productID=609332&tab=1\n\nI have looked fairly extensively on sites including eBay, Yoox and Vestiaire Collective with no luck. Can you help me find my wedding dress?!\n","category2":"Admin Support","subcategory2":"Personal \/ Virtual Assistant","skills":["internet-research","virtual-assistant"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":50,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T16:15:26+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01169fa0db14d4ceae","client":{"country":"United Kingdom","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
