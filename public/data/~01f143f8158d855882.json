Unfortunately the export function on Google Forms is crap and only allows me to save the results as PDFs. I need someone to go through each the PDF results of each survey, extract the questions and answers, and convert each one into a nice, clean looking Word document. For an example of one survey result please see the PDF attached. \n\nI need this done as quickly as possible - ideally one day, two days maximum.
