The app should primarily focus on cash management to begin with. An application I like is GNU cash. A basic general ledger with multi currency (all countries) is desired. Envision a cash book keeping app to be deployed in developing countries where handling of cash is still very relevant and necessary. First would be to have a high adoption rate of using this application to replace cash collection books used in developing countries' trading markets. \nMy vision, basically, is to eventually develop an UBER for physical cash currency conversion. May the journey begin.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Other - Software Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":1000,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-31T00:05:32+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01c2e7942d97933b58","client":{"country":"United Kingdom","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
