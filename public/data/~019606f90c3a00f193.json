{"id":"~019606f90c3a00f193","title":"SOAP Web service client for Excel in VBA XML Scrape","snippet":"One of the shipping providers my company uses hosts a web service to issue shipping quotes in SOAP format. I have coded some scraping utilities for a Google API and another which parse XML, but I am having trouble with this one. I need to be able to specify parameters in Excel cells, get shipping quotes in XML, parse the data, and populate cells in Excel with the data. I expect this to take no more than 2 hours of an expert's time since I can do most of the coding and debugging with an expert's help.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["api-development","data-scraping","excel-vba","microsoft-excel","soap","web-scraping","xml"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T03:08:29+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~019606f90c3a00f193","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":2,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":null}}
