Currently my product page has a button that says \"Purchase on Etsy\" and I would like to change this to the Shopify \"Buy now\" button. I am looking for someone who can set this up for me and also help me get my Shopify store set up properly so that it is ready to be used (get automatic emails set up for sales etc.)","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":null,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T05:56:34+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01095578d163a369e3","client":{"country":"Australia","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":3,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
