{"id":"~01682cc7e3974294b4","title":"Arena Exercise","snippet":"Business Process Simulation \u2013 Discrete Event Simulation and Queueing Theory\r\n\r\nThe assignment contains two parts: \r\n1.\tProject description, which formulates a mini-project\r\n2.\tProject report, which documents the mini-project work and results\r\nProject description should be 1-2 pages long, clearly introducing (fictive data):\r\n\u2022\tCompany description\r\n\u2022\tProduction\/service description\r\n\u2022\tProblem statement\r\n\u2022\tProject scope and objectives\r\nThe problem should be at a proper complexity level, in principle like the supply chain exercise included below; on top of it, practical implications should be considered. \r\nProject report should be 8-15 pages long and include the following:\r\n\u2022\tDocument the work following \u2018the lifecycle of a simulation project\u2019\r\n\u2022\tDevelop some performance measurements if necessary\r\n\u2022\tDescribe the data collection and analysis\r\n\u2022\tContain a AS-IS process map and solution (to-be) map \r\n\u2022\tContain a sensitivity analysis if possible\r\n\u2022\tExplain why Queueing Theory can or cannot be applied\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot upload the document here, so I copy & pasted the requirements. You will probably need the whole document to understand the full picture. I will also provide you with the Sample Data.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: This should be a very easy project for you. We're students in our first year, so you can imagine the complexity of this project is quite low.
