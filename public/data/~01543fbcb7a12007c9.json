{"id":"~01543fbcb7a12007c9","title":"Large Database SEO Architect for 1M+ page website","snippet":"We are a small, specialized, industrial B2B wholesale distributor of electronic components. We handle a database of over 1 million part numbers from the various manufacturers we support through our e-commerce website. We are having issues achieving good SEO performance even after applying best practices and believe this is a more technical problem than a content\/keyword problem as our products rely on part numbers (SKUs) for searching.\n\nWe seek an experienced SEO expert experienced handling large MySQL\/PHP websites with a B2B SEO track record. We would like to have a consultation with the following goals:\n\n-Discuss our known technical issues\n-Audit current page code\n-Audit indexing, caching, crawling, serving strategies\n-Audit current server and database architecture\n-Provide recommendations and strategy for improvement\n\nCurrently this job is only for a consultation for 3rd party audit and recommendation. However, if, after discussing a strategy, we feel confident in your abilities then we can discuss the project further and decide how to implement the proposed solutions on an ongoing basis for continuous improvement.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["php","web-design","website-development"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T19:48:06+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01543fbcb7a12007c9","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":2.0048390102,"reviews_count":2,"jobs_posted":5,"past_hires":3,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
