{"id":"~0184bf34cd1e557295","title":"Creative Cloud & Stack Desktop app developer","snippet":"I'm looking for one or more programmers for a mid- to long-term contract with the possibility of ongoing work. zenColor owns the patents on certain color normalization technologies and one of the projects we're working on is a design tool. \n\nWe're looking for people with experience in one or more of the following technologies:\n    Angular 2 (late beta or release)\n    Adobe Extendscript\n    Adobe Creative Cloud extension building\n    Full Stack (HTML5\/JS\/CSS) desktop application programming\nWe need someone who can take well-defined operations and implement them. The time frame is immediate and the developer can work remotely.\n\nIn order to properly vet any potential programmers, we have a small test that should take an hour or two at the most. Using the technologies above, either describe the technical steps or write a small app to grab a single color off of an image. The image can be loaded into the app or can exist in a different program. An example of the functionality can be found here:\n    http:\/\/www.imagecolorpicker.com\nThis is a test of your knowledge of the functionality and how the app looks does not matter. A working, clunky app is a success for this test. If it takes more than an hour or two, you're on the wrong track.\n\nYou can send your resume and test results to md@zencolor.com. I'll also need your rate and when you can be available to start. \n\nThanks\nMichael Dinowitz\nCTO - zenColor.com","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Other - Software Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T09:45:24+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0184bf34cd1e557295","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
