Interested primarily in information about businesses globally.  sample data to be obtained (could change a bit)\n- name\n- phone numbers\n- address (complete, with geo loc)\n- #of reviews\n- rating\n- pictures links\n- hours\n- more business info\n- price range\nReviews is not a must, but could be used.  Could be the first 5 reviews. \n\nWe'd like to see a sample, and of course need experienced scrapers that could deal with this site. A refresh might be needed every month . \n\nData should be delivered and uploaded to a cloud repository. If done right, other sites could be asked, looking for a long term and professional relationship. \n\nthanks\n\nJames\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["data-scraping","python","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":100,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T18:56:29+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01d591e106071143ad","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
