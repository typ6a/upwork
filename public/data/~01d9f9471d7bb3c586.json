{"id":"~01d9f9471d7bb3c586","title":"Need Help Setting up a Predictive Model for a Nonlinear data set","snippet":"I have a data set with a number of unique keys. Each unique key has data for how much distance it has traveled (weekly data), and the associated date that it was collected. For the unique keys with at least two records of data (similarly, two weeks of data), I need to predict  the next seven days of data, or week ahead.\n\nFor example:\nUniqueKey = {12345678, 12345678, 12345678, 12345678}\nDate = {7\/1\/2016, 7\/8\/2016, 7\/15\/2016, 7\/22\/2016}\nDistance = {45, 1935, 3203, 7883}\n\nWith these four records of data for this unique key, I would like to predict the next week's worth of data (divided into 7 individual values for each day)\n\nDistance will always be cumulatively increasing.\n\nI have this data set available for you to work with, and would like to see the error for whatever predictive model (preferably a machine learning technology like a neural network) to see how well the predictive model is working for the number of distance events (records). I.e., error for 2 events, 3 events, 5 events, 10 events, etc.\n\nThis is kind of a short\/quick project and I need it done quickly so please only apply for job if readily available to start working on this.","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Machine Learning","skills":["data-modeling","machine-learning","r"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-31T00:28:35+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01d9f9471d7bb3c586","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9356556642,"reviews_count":5,"jobs_posted":13,"past_hires":8,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
