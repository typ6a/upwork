{"id":"~017976ace5a4d7e34b","title":"WHMCS new invoice status called \"Partially Paid\"","snippet":"I need to distinguish the invoices that have partial payment in the transactions. Currently i cannot find any option to filter those invoices as invoice status show as Unpaid.\n\nIs it possible to make new status called \"Partially Paid\" ? which should be set when transactions didn't cover the full due amount?. So, if partial payment added the invoice status automatically changed to \"Partially Paid\". When final payment added status changed to Paid.\n\nThere is new status in version 6 called \"Collection\" I am not sure what is this used for. If creating new status not doable, is it possible to utilize for this project, any invoice with partial payment should be set to \"Collection\" state. Then we might be able to rename it in language file.\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["whmcs"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":100,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T18:06:54+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~017976ace5a4d7e34b","client":{"country":"Saudi Arabia","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
