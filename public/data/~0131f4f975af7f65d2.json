{"id":"~0131f4f975af7f65d2","title":"I need an Excel spreadsheet formatted so that I can import into an online database.","snippet":"I have an Excel spreadsheet with data containing information about a specific business niche that has been collected over the last 3 years. I need to import the data into a new database, but the fields for each business entry are lumped together in the Excel spreadsheet. Some entries have multiple years of data (inspection reviews) associated with them.  I need each inspection review to be it's own item, but correlated to the correct business to be imported correctly into the new database. I need them to be separated out into a format that I can easily import.  In summary, I need my spreadsheet cleaned up for easy import to avoid manual data entry.  I will send over the file once I have hired a freelancer.
