Its a lot of copy paste type stuff but important to us that it is done right. \n\nPlease apply if you can start now and work during the day today (US time). We will probably hire a couple of people to work together on this. We can communicate as a group using Slack.\n\nyou wont be coding any html but it is kinda helpful if you know some basics of html and formatting so we can make sure as we copy and paste that the content is moving over correctly.","category2":"Admin Support","subcategory2":"Data Entry","skills":["data-entry","html"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T16:00:15+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0145af9b3356ead549","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9365988755,"reviews_count":94,"jobs_posted":505,"past_hires":306,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
