Would like this to look great and modern, sleek and technically smooth.","snippet":"Looking for someone experienced with Weebly design for over a year with several completed projects \\ sites I could review.  We are an IT managed service company and need the site to work excellently, look modern, smooth, and friendly.\n\nWe are also considering reselling web design services, and of course by this job posting, we do not do that ourselves.  We would be looking for a start of a good relationship for our current site.  Then some future smaller projects and website designs for our IT clients.\n\nI do have several snippets I've collected over the years of wordings, site designs, things to include in the website.  I've yet to collect all of these, but can do this once we feel we've found the correct person for our website and future websies.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["weebly"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T20:37:31+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01474c63bed66ab746","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
