{"id":"~01065f25f6f745b853","title":"I need a graphic designed super fast. Simple, clean, and good. It will be used to paint onto a wood sign.","snippet":"We run a small wood sign making business in Louisiana. We will need fresh designs from time to time to build traffic. \n\nFor this first proposal, we need it very quickly. If we like your work, we will want to propose other ideas and graphics for your to complete with adequate time. Since we are working with wood we cannot use super tiny or very thin scripted fonts.\n \nFor this first proposal we need a specific phrase \"I make my own roux\". The design needs to be able to fit a square sign. We are looking to have this graphic fit an 11x11 wood sign.\n\nPlease see the attached picture of our current design for this particular sign. We feel it is very lack luster, and could be much better. If you are someone that hand-letters their own fonts, that is a super bonus. Also, designing for t-shirts is another added bonus. We require you to have a wide collection of fonts to use, and be able to save your work as jpg, png, and AI.","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Graphic Design","skills":["adobe-illustrator","graphic-design","logo-design"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":30,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T18:26:55+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01065f25f6f745b853","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":2,"past_hires":2,"payment_verification_status":null}}
