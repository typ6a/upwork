{"id":"~01b1f10c899f74244e","title":"IBM i\/OS400 Cloud Hosting","snippet":"My company has been in business since 1979. We provide application cloud hosting for IBM i\/AS400\/iSeries users - a popular server with about 30,000 users in North America. We need outbound calling to follow up on our direct mail letters we send to targeted IBM users. We provide training (videos and related content) about our market, our product, our marketing strategy, how to use our online predictive dialer, how to make a call (we provide scripts), how to document call outcome (we use special codes)  and how to collect valuable information when you make calls, even with those prospects that may not have an interest. We are accessible to answer questions you may have from calls you encounter, provide explanation of terminology and technology you may want to know and on-going coaching. We are looking for an outbound calling pro with an engaging voice and the experience to work politely with the receptionist to get to the targeted company contact, generally the MIS or IT Manager. We prefer you to make calls on Tuesday through Thursday, for 4 hours between 8-12 depending on the assigned time zone. Accurate data collection from calls is a must.","category2":"Sales & Marketing","subcategory2":"Lead Generation","skills":[],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":null,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T21:36:31+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01b1f10c899f74244e","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":null}}
