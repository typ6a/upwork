{"id":"~018b6973d005c3059f","title":"I need a developer to help us wrap up  the back-end and architecture of a website","snippet":"Looking for an experienced developer for a 4-week full-time project to help us finish off our website. We have built a site that collects information from a user on the front-end (front end built in Java and HTML), then stores this data in a MySQL database (uses python and SQL for connections), and then we run a program written in R that analyzes the stored data and creates output jpgs and html files, that are then shown on the website to the user. We need someone who is very knowledgeable in Python, Django Framework, SQL, and MySQL. As an example, on our website we ask a user to input monthly utility data. The program is designed to use 24 months of data entered by the user, but originally it was written to use a set 24 month period. Going forward we want the program to use the most recent 24 months of data. We have a front-end developer who is upgrading our site, that you will work with, but you need to be able to work through our remaining bugs, and understand the entire architecture quickly so you can help improve it. We have a back-end developer who designed everything that will be able to walk you through everything that was created so far.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["mysql","mysql-programming","python","sql"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"30+ hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T15:52:34+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018b6973d005c3059f","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"UNKNOWN"}}
