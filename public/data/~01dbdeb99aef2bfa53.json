Maybe Ubot Studio or Dexi.io? Other? This software will be running 24 hours a day so we will put it on a dedicated server or virtual machine.\n\n2) Log into certain websites on a schedule and scrape customer usage information. Then send that information to a email address or publish it to a internal website or file.  We use this information to bill our customers.\n\n3) Setup scripts that read flat files, or csv's.  These files are customer orders. Based on the information in the order, the script will then need to log into certain supplier websites and place orders using the information in the flat file or csv. In some cases only emails will need to be sent.\n\nWhen responding to this job posting, please keep in mind this will be a longer term engagement, and we are looking for someone to help us decide the proper direction.\n\nAlso, please let us know your software of choice to use for this automation.\n\nThanks!\n\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Scripts & Utilities","skills":["automation","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"More than 6 months","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T21:35:48+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01dbdeb99aef2bfa53","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":5,"reviews_count":22,"jobs_posted":38,"past_hires":27,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
