{"id":"~01fd577e1deec80519","title":"Create a hot cocoa bar mockup for my Etsy shop","snippet":"I own an Etsy shop that specializes in printable items. I would like to market my hot chocolate bar with a mockup to display the items and make them more appealing to the eye.\n\nI have a selection of items for the Cocoa bar that need to be photoshopped together. Some examples include whipped cream, sprinkles, and chocolate sauce. You will need to know how to arrange these images together along with my signs to make it look like a real hot chocolate bar.\n\nI have a few other bar collections as well, so if successful on the first project, I will assign 2-3 more.\n\nUpon interviewing I will send over some images from my shop as well as some inspiration images to help you understand what I am hoping for.\n\nFor somebody skilled in photoshop this project should take less than 20 minutes.","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Graphic Design","skills":["adobe-illustrator","adobe-photoshop","graphic-design","photo-editing"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":10,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T13:15:02+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01fd577e1deec80519","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":1,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
