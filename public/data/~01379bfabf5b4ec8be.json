Then give a brief summary and explain ASTM D143 and describe the specimen dimensions. Then summarise the report structure.\n\nii.\tExplain the experiment plan and how the data is collected from each trial from the sample.\n\niii.\tLabelled graphs of the trials, the data for each student and a table showing the Young\u2019s modulus and ultimate strength of each trial.
