It is then uploaded into Domo nightly so that we can \"stitch\" it with our customer data records in our ERP system to provide us with attribution data.\nWe had it working at one point. However, it looks like the call data is missing a lot of calls in the last several weeks of data upload. \nWe need a SQL guru \/ ninja to help review the ShoreTel database call records to ensure we are extracting them correctly via the query in the workbench tool.\nThere exists a 'current calls' table and an 'archive' table with overlap, where they drop off after a certain amount of time from the current calls and go to the 'archive' table, but we want both with no overlap.\n\nExtra ++ if you have Domo experience and can assist in stitching the archive and current calls datasets.\n\n","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Mining & Management","skills":["data-mining","mysql-programming","sql","sql-programming"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":400,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T22:10:44+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01a783812041556587","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":8,"jobs_posted":36,"past_hires":17,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
