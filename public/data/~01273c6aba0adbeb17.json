I have a list of 20 zip codes and I need 3 hospitals information for each zip code in an excel file that is attached below. Add \"wow\" at the end of your letter so that I know you have read the job properly\"\n\nThese are very easy to collect from Google first page if you search with this keyword \"Dentists in (zipcode)\". You will find the info on mapping section in the first page and will take the first 3 results(excluding ads). This will be at most 3 hours of work.\n\nStill I need you to be very careful with the data as the phone numbers, addresses and websites must be accurate and will be randomly checked once completed.","category2":"Admin Support","subcategory2":"Data Entry","skills":["data-entry","internet-research","microsoft-word"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":8,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T19:13:00+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01273c6aba0adbeb17","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
