{"id":"~01b79522933a696665","title":"PHP (WordPress) Developer for Munich based startup","snippet":"Nowadays, Google probably knows more about different industries than the industry leaders themselves. Together with our customer we we\u2018re developing a product (web app) to make that knowledge more accessible to industry leaders who want to stay ahead of the curb.\nIt's basically a trend analysis database that crawls trends, innovations, and patents from different sources and displays them graph-based in order to show their context.\n\nThe base of this complex system is a WordPress system that connects to all kinds of different tools (e.g. ArangoDB, TextRazor). Your main task would be to develop and extend WordPress Plugins and integrate external APIs and components in this system. Also there's a bit of Frontend work to do (mainly WordPress templates).\n\nThe project requires really good PHP skills and experience in customized WordPress systems.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["css","html5","javascript","php","wordpress"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"1 to 3 months","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T13:10:29+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01b79522933a696665","client":{"country":"Germany","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":8,"past_hires":4,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
