{"id":"~01155ceea9a496a070","title":"Multi Step Form Need","snippet":"I currently have a form that collects email address, address information, and basic interests for collecting stamps. The form currently adds the lead information into Method.me. A multi step form is needed in order to make the potential lead feel like the process is short and simple instead of a long single form. The current form has a custom script attached in order to process a few of the fields into a customer id number. \nI believe the form should be built using AJAX and only POST once at the end of the last step. The form will be broken into 3 steps.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["css","css3","html","html5","javascript","web-design","website-development","wordpress"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":50,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T21:42:04+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01155ceea9a496a070","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9906606902,"reviews_count":49,"jobs_posted":68,"past_hires":72,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
