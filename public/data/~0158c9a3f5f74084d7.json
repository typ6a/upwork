Fix size and position of email collection bar so its centered on moweb and tablet (looks fine on desktop)\n\u200b\n2. Make horizontal line separating header from banner photo 3x thicker (for all platforms)\n\n3. Change background color of a) horizontal line from (2) above, b) email collection \"Join our community\" button (in two spots on site), and c) add to cart button (button changes color on highlight only which is what i want, but want color to change to my choosing) on product page and checkout button on popup modal (below). Color will actually be gradient, so I will provide color as image file. \n\u200b\n\u200b4. Need to modify font and size in space below (where it says 'WIP) so it doesn't impact font\/size in other parts of site. Also want to add graphic (horizontal wavy line) to act as section break. \n\nSee files below for screenshots. Need you to get on skype with me and walk me to how to do the above, sharing my screen. Should take 1 hour or less. $15 fixed price for this. \n\n","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":15,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T01:45:57+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0158c9a3f5f74084d7","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":1.75,"reviews_count":1,"jobs_posted":4,"past_hires":2,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
