{"id":"~0120d97f89c5a3ed3c","title":"Photograph Historic Memorabilia Items for a Blog (Fort Worth, TX)","snippet":"Hello,\n\nI need a photographer who can take a series of professional quality pictures of a collection of historic memorabilia mostly from the 1960's and 70's (catalogs, toys, radios, etc.).   These photographs would then be posted on a  blog. There will be about 25 items and I would need about 4 pictures of each. I would expect the photo session (on October 31st) to take roughly 3 hours and there would probably be 2 hours two set up and upload the photos after the session to a DropBox.  (There might need to be a second session later in the week of October 31st, probably on Wednesday or Thursday.)\n\nWhat kind of a camera do you have? \nDo you have any examples of your work?\nDo you have flexibility to work on Monday October 31st in the afternoon? \nAre you based in or near Fort Worth, TX?\nWhat other materials (lighting etc.) would you need?\n\nPhoto session would probably be at or near a university campus in Fort Worth. \nThis would be a \"work for hire\" project and any copyright would be assigned. \n(This is a one-off project, but there is a chance there may be more projects like this.)\n\nI would like to figure out what a total budget for this project would be up front; ideally, I would like to agree on a budget with someone today (Friday, October 28). \n\nLet me know if you have have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nJoe Mullin\n","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Photography","skills":["digital-photography","photography"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T16:00:39+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0120d97f89c5a3ed3c","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":3,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
