{"id":"~017f0aa88f8a2e790d","title":"Male actor needed for live event (2 hours) in Orlando, FL","snippet":"We\u2019re looking for an actor to appear at a technology-related tradeshow in Orlando, FL on Wed, Nov 9. The gig will run from 6:30 pm to approximately 8:30 pm. We\u2019re looking for a male between 25 and 50 years of age. \n\nYou will come to the event pretending to be a conference attendee (we will register a badge for you). You will walk around the trade show floor for about 30 minutes wearing a golf shirt, a pair of boxers, socks and shoes \u2014 but no pants. You will pretend that nothing is wrong and carry on as though you\u2019re there to collect information for your business.\n\nYou will not be expected to talk to any vendors. You will be given guidance on how to respond if other attendees approach you. You will have your picture taken and the photos will be shared on social media.\n\nAfter the first 30 minutes, you will go to our company\u2019s tradeshow booth for more photos. And that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a very easy gig. We will pay for 2 hours but it likely won\u2019t take the full time.\n\nThe key will be walking around in your boxers like it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. :)\n\nAny questions, just ask.","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Other - Design & Creative","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":300,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T15:03:50+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~017f0aa88f8a2e790d","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":4.9101379278,"reviews_count":10,"jobs_posted":20,"past_hires":20,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
