{"id":"~0162bad49c0b4f3ec0","title":"Need help fixing sleezy collections attempts that has hurt my credit + bonus potential","snippet":"I need someone familiar with credit repair in the US.  Native speaking English only please.\n\nA company claims I owe them about $2,000.  I've refused to pay because the product they say I need to pay for I never asked for, never used, and never received.  I believe it was sneakily slipped into the contract when I signed up for Authorize.net to take specific types of credit card transactions.  I've already paid them about $1,000 and feel that that is enough for something that provide me with 0 value!\n\nI've tried multiple times to go through their dispute process, but the rep on the account was extremely unresponsive.  They've sent me to collections.  I've contacted multiple places and am having a hard time figuring out how to get this BS off my credit.\n\nPlease Help!\n\nI suspect that I should contact credit agencies and let them know this is in dispute, but am unsure the best way to proceed.\n\nTo show you've read this job description, please give me your favorite color in your cover letter.\n\nI'm also guessing there are many actions I\/you could take to get this moving.  I'm open to new suggestions for us to take. I've been trying to solve this for months.\n\nPlease give me a general idea of what you would do to fix my problem.\n\nThanks,\nDavid","category2":"Accounting & Consulting","subcategory2":"Other - Accounting & Consulting","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T15:58:31+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0162bad49c0b4f3ec0","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9843431709,"reviews_count":166,"jobs_posted":264,"past_hires":318,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
