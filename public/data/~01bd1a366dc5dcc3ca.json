We would need someone who can design a system that will output what we need and be user friendly.  \n\nThis will probably be a long term ongoing process with the initial stage being research, then execution, usage, changes, additions.  To discuss further please message me. \n\nThanks\nJoe  ","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Data Mining & Management","skills":["data-logistics","data-modeling","data-scraping","web-scraping"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":500,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T17:08:51+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01bd1a366dc5dcc3ca","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":3,"jobs_posted":7,"past_hires":5,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
