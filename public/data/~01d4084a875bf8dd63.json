{"id":"~01d4084a875bf8dd63","title":"Web Scrape various websites from a Master Website providing links to the websites","snippet":"We are looking for someone to build a list of companies, and their contact details, from the companies' websites. \n\nWe will provide you with an Input file. The Input file contains a list of: Company Name, Services Provided, Website, and will include some address information (country, and city and\/or state) in Excel format. There are roughly 5,000 links to company websites (about 50% are duplicates).   \n\nThe Output required is an Excel file. The Output columns are as follows....(where available) company name, contact person, phone, email, website, address line1, address line2, state, zip code, and country. See sample output spreadsheet (attached).\n\nSome companies may have multiple locations in one country.  We require the contact details of each location.  The name of the company needs to be accurately recorded, particularly for multi-location companies (where each location has a unique website) for later sorting in excel.  Where one website services multiple locations, we require multiple entries in the output file (one entry for each location).   Finally, you will need to combine the Output file with the Input file.
