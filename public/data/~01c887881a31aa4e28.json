{"id":"~01c887881a31aa4e28","title":"Laboratory design assistance","snippet":"I'm looking for someone with experience in designing modern, good looking lab space. Design is critical here, it should LOOK good as well as be functional.\n\nSome examples of nice lab styles:\n\n1. https:\/\/thiemt.com\/user_static\/images\/content\/labormoebel-waldner-2.jpg\n\n2. http:\/\/labs.waldner-lab.de\/typo3temp\/pics\/d7eaf9ef11.jpg\n\n3. http:\/\/benchmarkcl.com\/wp-content\/themes\/Benchmark\/css\/images\/ChemistsBenches2.jpg\n\nNot only will you need very good design style but you should also be very knowledgeable about general lab requirements. For example configuration for service inputs, fume extraction, compressed air, etc.\n\nIf you've done this before, feel free to bid. I have a lot of ideas but need someone to help me lay it out so that all of the furniture selection, flooring, electrical, ventilation, and air input work is ideally configured so that there aren't a lot of exposed cables, etc. We can add columns to bring in service if it helps. \n\nThe space is roughly 300SF (see area in attachment outlined in pink). I also have the CAD file to save you some time.\n\nIf you feel you're qualified, please leave a message and I'll share the rest of the details with you. From there we can determine your bid and make the necessary adjustments so that you can get started.\n\nThank you!","category2":"Engineering & Architecture","subcategory2":"Interior Design","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":500,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-29T21:10:08+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01c887881a31aa4e28","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":5,"reviews_count":15,"jobs_posted":250,"past_hires":121,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
