The script will then go to a website and parse the text for each product. Then create a new csv file that contains all the original information + the text for each product. \n\nIt should be possible to run the script every x hours through cron so it updates the file. \n\nMore details will be given after initial contact. Please send a message with details, quote, delivery time and when you can start. We need this done urgently.\n\nWe need these kind of scripts done on regular basis so if everything works good we will have more work for you.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Other - Software Development","skills":["curl","python","scrapy-framework"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":30,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T15:42:06+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~014b358758610e0ca0","client":{"country":"Sweden","feedback":4.9351851852,"reviews_count":3,"jobs_posted":26,"past_hires":12,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
