{"id":"~0101ea48e830b6c886","title":"Multi-screen background scenics video","snippet":"This project includes finding clips online (youtube, vimeo, etc), downloading them, and editing them together in an interesting way into a super-wide multi-screen video (5:1).  Because this video is for a closed one-time event, we are not concerned with copyright.\n\nSee screenshots for examples. I have some clips collected already to get the project started. Very specific project details offered once project begins. This project is a very tight turnaround. Generous bonus will be offered for excellent work and completing tasks on-schedule or ahead of schedule.\n\nPotential for collaboration on many future projects if we like the work!","category2":"Design & Creative","subcategory2":"Video Production","skills":["adobe-after-effects","adobe-premiere-pro","video-editing"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":1050,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T11:51:45+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0101ea48e830b6c886","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":1,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
