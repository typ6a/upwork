{"id":"~01e52a5a2552f1f759","title":"Online form design and creation","snippet":"This is a relatively straightforward project to update our order management forms to provide a consistent branding and style.  \n\nOur business provides subscription-based services and products.  New member signup and subscription selection is handled using one application (aMember), and payment collection and fulfillment is handled by another (FastSpring).  Both applications are running w their default formats for forms and e-mails, and we'd like the UX to be integrated so users don't feel like they are being handed off between systems to complete an order.  \n\nThe scope of this project is to create forms with a consistent branding and UX across these two applications.  We'll need these forms completed:  \nNew User Signup (aMember)\nProduct Selection (aMember)\nNew Account Confirmation E-Mail (aMember)\nPayment (FastSpring)\nInvoice (FastSpring)\nPayment Receipt E-Mails (Fast Spring)\nTemplate Correspondence Emails (for general use)\n\nThis should be a relatively straightforward project.  We can provide logo and brand data (color palette).  We're not too picky on the wording - can't be overly sterile but otherwise we'd like it if you could bring a starting point from prior experience.  Both FastSpring and aMember have editing capability, but some custom CSS may be required.\n\n","category2":"Writing","subcategory2":"Web Content","skills":["copywriting","css"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 month","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T02:41:49+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01e52a5a2552f1f759","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.9555649598,"reviews_count":12,"jobs_posted":18,"past_hires":15,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
