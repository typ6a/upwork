I am specifically looking for Seagate hard drives sold in the following zip codes: 95014 and 80501.  \n\nI want you to build a spreadsheet containing the link to each listing, the serial number, and the seller name that is selling the product.  \n\nSearch \"Seagate\" using each zip code, then click into each listing and copy the serial number from each Seagate item sold.  The serial number will say \"Serial\", \"Serial no.\" or \"SN\".  When you've reached the bottom of the page, click on load more, and keep going until you've reached the end for all the items listed, and move on to the next zip code.  \n\nIf there is no serial number or they are hiding it, please note in your spreadsheet.","category2":"Admin Support","subcategory2":"Personal \/ Virtual Assistant","skills":[],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":5,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T17:15:59+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018f86cb45fe568c27","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":1,"past_hires":1,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
