It's inspired by the Mountain Bike Downhill, Freeride, Slopestyle and Dirtjump culture; and is dedicated to this demographic.\n\nMy website is www.gravity-theshop.com; my Instagram account is @gravity_riders \n\nI currently only sell lifestyle clothing (hats, tees and hoodies).\n\nIn order to grow my brand, I will start selling \"technical\" riding gear like jerseys, shorts, gloves, etc.\n\nTherefore, I'm looking for a designer to create the design of a mountain bike jersey. The design will include one of my logo that is currently used in one the tees of the Gravity collection. I will provide the logo that will need to be used in the general design of the jersey; and the jersey template.\n\nHere are brand I want to model and \/ or that inspire me:\n\nFox: https:\/\/www.foxracing.com\/us\/mtb\/\nTroy Lee Design: http:\/\/www.troyleedesigns.com\/\nRocday: https:\/\/www.rocday.com\/?page=2&kat=1&lang=1\n100%: http:\/\/www.ride100percent.com\/mountainbike\/mens-downhill\/\nVolcom: http:\/\/www.volcom.com\/\n\nIf you're excited by this project, please apply for it!
