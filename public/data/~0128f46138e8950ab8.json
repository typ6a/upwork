I need someone to go in and figure out what has happened and fix it.  When you select \"Visit Site\" from the dashboard, the website appears as it should.  But when visited any other way (e.g. through a different browser or tab) it appears as you currently see it at www.not2broke2fix.com.  \n\nI designed the site a year ago and have only provided minor updates to it periodically, so I do not remember how the front page works - it is a complex collection of widgets and sliders.\n\nOnce the problem has been fixed, I will require a brief tutorial or written description regarding what the problem was and how it was fixed.\n\nI will provide a temporary administrator-level login for this job.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Web Development","skills":["web-design","website-development","wordpress"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":100,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T22:36:15+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0128f46138e8950ab8","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":0,"past_hires":0,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
