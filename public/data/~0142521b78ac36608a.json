{"id":"~0142521b78ac36608a","title":"Create Excel VBA code to extract data from website","snippet":"Each month, the website below posts updated statistics. I would like to create a Excel VBA macro that goes to the link and retrieves the data (either directly from the source code or by performing the \"Download to Excel\" function at the bottom of the page).\n\nI then need that data pasted in the spreadsheet, with a pit of cleaning up.\n\nExample of Link: http:\/\/medicarestatistics.humanservices.gov.au\/statistics\/do.jsp?_PROGRAM=%2Fstatistics%2Fmbs_group_standard_report&DRILL=on&GROUP=Broad+Type+of+Service+%28BTOS%29&VAR=services&STAT=count&RPT_FMT=by+time+period+and+state&PTYPE=month&START_DT=201609&END_DT=201609\n\nThat's the simple version of the project. I will give more details when the right person is selected for the job. Feel free to ask questions to clarify anything about the project.","category2":"Data Science & Analytics","subcategory2":"Other - Data Science & Analytics","skills":["excel-vba"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"Less than 1 week","workload":"10-30 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T01:56:17+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0142521b78ac36608a","client":{"country":"Australia","feedback":0,"reviews_count":0,"jobs_posted":6,"past_hires":3,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
