{"id":"~018bf6c916c67b53c7","title":"Maintain my C#\/Selenium desktop application","snippet":"I built a very large desktop application in 2011. I maintained it until 2014 then stopped. Now I want to fix it up, add new features and release it again.\n\nThe software is mainly a commercial web scraping bot. Users provide credentials for a number of different sites, and we use Selenium (and PhantomJS) to login and scrape the data. We use a number of ObjectListViews and other grid objects to display. There are multiple forms.\n\nI am a programmer myself, but I need to hire a programmer to help as there is a lot of work remaining.\n\nI will help plan out the direction for each method of the software. Your job is to write the code for each function signature. Error handling is of utmost priority. Every function call must catch all exceptions. Implicit waits are bad practice. These are just some of the things I'll be watching for.\n\nA lot of this is already done, but I need someone to help with the remainder. \n\nYour job is to:\n- fork the repo from Git\n- implement bug fixes\n- implement new features that haven't been coded\n- comment out unused code\n- test thoroughly to make sure all bugs will be handled if there are 100+ users\n\nI will be testing and tracking progress during logged hours. You will be expected to make commits to Git for each time you work.","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Desktop Software Development","skills":["c#","selenium"],"job_type":"Hourly","budget":0,"duration":"3 to 6 months","workload":"Less than 10 hrs\/week","job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-27T18:29:28+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~018bf6c916c67b53c7","client":{"country":"Canada","feedback":4.7868600168,"reviews_count":66,"jobs_posted":323,"past_hires":201,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
