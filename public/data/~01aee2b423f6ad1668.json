{"id":"~01aee2b423f6ad1668","title":"Looking for translators for a language learning app - French, German, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese and Russian","snippet":"Hello,\n\nI have an iOS app that I want to translate from English to 6 other languages:\nFrench, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, German and Russian.\n\nThe work consists of:\n* Translating the help texts of the app. These texts are currently in html. The translator should preserve the existing html tags. The help texts contain 4708 words. \n* Translating the labels of the app. These labels will be translated on a separate website - see screenshot -. On the left is the text that needs to be translated. In the middle is sometimes a comment that clarifies a word or gives additional instructions. On the right the translations should be entered. The labels of the app consist of 5241 words.\n* Translating 3 other small collections of labels, which need to be done the same was as the labels of the app: in app purchase names and descriptions(243 words), some sections of the updated privacy policy(124 words) and badge\/award descriptions(225 words).\n* Translating the app description which will be sent as a separate text(307 words).\n* Translating the keywords of the app(10 words).\n\nIn total this amounts to 10858 words. I\u2019m thinking about a budget of 150$ per language.\n\nEach bidder should apply for the translation of one language only. Bids on multiple languages will not be considered. When bidding, clearly mention the language to which you will translate to.","category2":"Translation","subcategory2":"General Translation","skills":["translation"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":150,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-30T14:00:22+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~01aee2b423f6ad1668","client":{"country":"Belgium","feedback":4.8873557619,"reviews_count":26,"jobs_posted":23,"past_hires":32,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
