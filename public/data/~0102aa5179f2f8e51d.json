{"id":"~0102aa5179f2f8e51d","title":"Shopify expert needed to help setup e-commerce\/ handle CSS modifications","snippet":"Hi all-\n\nWe currently have a test site using Joomla CMS at srstaging.com\/sacstaging. There's an e-commerce side to the site which will be on Shopify. We're looking for someone to style the Shopify instance so it matches the site. The user should not know they are going to\/ from the non-ecommerce site listed above or the Shopify site. Uploading products and shop configuration is not part of the scope, and has already been handled by us.\n\nWhat is in scope...\n\n1) Use a theme that has the AJAX shopping cart 'fly-out' from the left side of the screen, or on the page (similar to https:\/\/noren-demo.myshopify.com\/collections\/all\/products\/briefcase)\n2) Style the Shopify site with the same header as the site listed above.\n3) Utilize some functionality or the Shopify API to display a \"Cart\" button on the Joomla site to display the Shopify cart when they are not on the e-commerce site. I've attached a mockup of what this could look like (please see the cart icon to the right of the menu)\n\nWe do ask that the contractor is available during at least 4-5 hours during the U.S. Central time zone schedule.\n\nBest,\nKevin","category2":"Web, Mobile & Software Dev","subcategory2":"Ecommerce Development","skills":["css","html","shopify","web-design","website-development"],"job_type":"Fixed","budget":500,"duration":null,"workload":null,"job_status":"Open","date_created":"2016-10-28T21:04:04+0000","url":"http:\/\/www.upwork.com\/jobs\/~0102aa5179f2f8e51d","client":{"country":"United States","feedback":4.8279924873,"reviews_count":37,"jobs_posted":54,"past_hires":55,"payment_verification_status":"VERIFIED"}}
