PHPoAuthLib Readme
======
PHPoAuthLib provides oAuth support in PHP 5.3+ and is very easy to integrate with any project which requires an oAuth client.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lusitanian/PHPoAuthLib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lusitanian/PHPoAuthLib)

Features
--------
- PSR-0 compliant for easy interoperability
- Fully extensible in every facet.
   - You can implement any service with any custom requirements by extending the protocol version's `AbstractService` implementation.
   - You can use any HTTP client you desire, just create a class utilizing it which implements `OAuth\Common\Http\ClientInterface` (a stream-based implementation is included)
   - You can use any storage mechanism for tokens. By default, session, in-memory and Redis.io (requires PHPRedis) storage mechanisms are included. Implement additional mechanisms by implementing `OAuth\Common\Token\TokenStorageInterface`.
